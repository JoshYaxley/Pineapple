* Split onStep into onBeforeStep and onStep, so don't have to remember to call base.onStep all the time
* Allow a timer to optionally be executed straight away
* Track new files made in built copy and re-create them in the source copy?
* Concept of "spritePlaybackSpeed" that can easily be set?
* Passing sprite as argument for texture gives weird error in "memory" file
