* Split onStep into onBeforeStep and onStep, so don't have to remember to call base.onStep all the time
* Allow a timer to optionally be executed straight away
* Track new files made in built copy and re-create them in the source copy?
* Concept of "spritePlaybackSpeed" that can easily be set?
* Passing sprite as argument for texture gives weird error in "memory" file
* Why does Enemy need to be a class and inherit from EnableChildList<T> for world->get(Child)List() to work?
* What's the difference between a constructor and onCreate()?
* Ideally the collision mask would be independent of the sprite
